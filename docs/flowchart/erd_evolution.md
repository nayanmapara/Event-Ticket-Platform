# 🎟️ Event Ticketing Platform - Development Flow

This documents the planning, modeling, and architecture thought process behind building a full-stack **Event Ticketing Platform** using **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React** (frontend).

The focus at this stage is on **system design** and **database modeling** to lay a strong foundation for future development.

---

## 🐈 Approach and Thinking Process

### 1. **Problem Understanding**

The core idea is to build a platform where:
- Organizers can create and manage events.
- Staff can assist organizers during events.
- Attendees can purchase, hold, and validate event tickets.
- Each ticket should have a unique identity (QR Code) and support validation workflows.

This required modeling various roles, entities, and their relationships.

---

### 2. **First Draft: Basic Entity Identification**

- Identified the main **actors**: Organizer, Staff, Attendee.
- Identified the main **objects**: Event, Ticket, TicketType.

At this stage:
- Simple one-to-many and many-to-one relationships were drawn.
- Only essential fields (id, name, email, etc.) were considered.
- No deep typing (like enums or UUIDs) was enforced yet.

### 3. **Second Draft: Introducing Data Types and Domain Constraints**

- Introduced **UUID** as the primary key type for consistency and security.
- Defined specific data types:
  - `String` for text fields.
  - `LocalDateTime` for timestamps.
  - `Double` for prices.
- Started introducing **Enums**:
  - `EventStatusEnum`
  - `TicketStatusEnum`

**Goal:** Stronger schema typing to avoid inconsistencies later.

---

### 4. **Third Draft: Enhancing Relationships and Attributes**

- Added **purchase flows**:
  - Tickets are purchased by users.
  - Tickets belong to ticket types.
- Added **validation tracking**:
  - TicketValidation entity records when and how a ticket is validated.
- Connected **QR Codes** to Tickets:
  - A ticket can have one or more associated QR Codes.

**Goal:** Capture the full lifecycle of a ticket from sale ➔ QR generation ➔ validation.

### 5. **Fourth Draft: Finalizing Data Model**

- Polished multiplicities (0..*, 1..*, etc.) based on business logic:
  - A user can buy multiple tickets.
  - A ticket can have multiple validations (re-entry scenarios).
- Solidified mandatory vs optional relationships:
  - Every Ticket **must** have a TicketType.
  - QR Code generation is mandatory upon Ticket creation.

- Final structure optimized for:
  - Easy future integration of authentication.
  - Clear separation between User Roles.
  - Support for complex ticket workflows.

## ✨ Key Design Principles Followed

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
  Modeling around the core business logic first.
  
- **Scalability-First Thinking**  
  UUIDs, typed fields, and extensible relationships for long-term scaling.

- **Responsibility Segregation**  
  Clear responsibilities for each entity and minimal overlap.

- **Future-Proofing**  
  Designed to allow future additions like seat selection, promotions, or event categories without major changes to core models.

## 🔢 Next Steps

- Implement database entities based on the final ERD.
- Build REST APIs following the domain models.
- Start React frontend scaffolding.
- Maintain versioned documentation under `/docs`.
